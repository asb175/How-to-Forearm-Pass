#How to Forearm Pass in Volleyball
## By: Ashley Browske




Forearm passing is one of the few skills needed in order to play volleyball. It is commonly the first touch out of the three the team gets. It involves getting your forearms and hands in a position where the volleyball will hit off of them and go to the target. 


## Materials Needed

- A volleyball
    >There are two different balls. One is softer and is used by beginners and the other has a rougher surface used by more advantaged or older players.
- A partner or teammate
- Your arms

## Steps for Passing

Many of these steps happen within miliseconds of each other but the order matters!

1. Face your partner or teammate who is holding the volleyball
2. Have the partner toss the ball towards you
3. Look at where the ball is going
4. Move your feet to adjust to the ball
5. Lock out your elbow so your arms are straight
6. Tilt your shoulders to create an angle
7. Put your hands together (palm on top of palm, thumbs together tilted down)
8. Have ball hit your arms right in the middle of your forearm 
9. Hold that angle towards your target

And of course practice makes perfect so keep redoing these steps until you get good at forearm passing.
